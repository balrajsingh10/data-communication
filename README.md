Election Management Database
This project aims to develop a database system to manage voter registration, election results, and candidate information. The database will be implemented using MongoDB, a NoSQL database management system.

Project Overview
The database will consist of three collections:

voter_registration: Stores information about registered voters, including their name, date of birth, gender, city, and registration date.

election_results: Records the results of elections, including the candidate name, number of votes received, district, and date of the election.

candidate_information: Contains details about candidates running for election, such as their name, affiliated party, years of experience, and age.

Project Tasks
Database Creation and Collection Setup
Use MongoDB to create the database and the three collections: voter_registration, election_results, and candidate_information.
Data Insertion
Insert sample data into each collection using the appropriate MongoDB commands.
Create an Excel file for each collection with sample data, and import it into the corresponding collection using the mongoimport command.
Data Manipulation
Populate each collection with additional documents to ensure a minimum of 10 documents in each.
Data Updates
Perform updates on documents within the collections using the updateOne() and updateMany() commands.
Data Retrieval
Use the findOne() and find() commands to retrieve documents from the collections.
Data Deletion
Delete documents from the collections using the deleteOne() and deleteMany() commands.
Database Workloads and Indexing
Identify common queries and workload patterns.
Create indexes on the collections based on workload analysis to optimize query performance.
Aggregation
Implement various aggregation processes using MongoDB's aggregation framework to perform data analysis.
Files Included
voter_registration.xlsx: Excel file containing sample data for the voter_registration collection.
election_results.xlsx: Excel file containing sample data for the election_results collection.
candidate_information.xlsx: Excel file containing sample data for the candidate_information collection.
README.md: This README file providing an overview of the project and instructions for setup and usage.
Getting Started
